        "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is one of the most promising recent developments in Deep Learning. GAN, introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, attacks the problem of unsupervised learning by training two deep networks, called Generator and Discriminator, that compete and cooperate with each other. In the course of training, both networks eventually learn how to perform their tasks."
